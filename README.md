📌 Overview
This project simulates key functionalities of an operating system for educational purposes. It allows users to interact with basic OS-level operations through a custom interface that includes file management, mini-programs, system tools, and games.

🔧 Features
🔹 File Management
Create, delete, rename, view files

Simulate file compression and decompression

🔹 Built-in Tools & Games
Notepad (write/save text)

Number Guessing Game

Hangman Game

🔹 Multimedia
Basic song/music player functionality

🔹 OS Core Concepts (Simulated)
Multitasking support

Process and thread management

User mode and kernel mode switching

Command-line interface (CLI) simulation

🎯 Purpose
To help students understand internal OS mechanisms by visualizing and interacting with simplified simulations of file systems, processes, memory, and more.

🛠️ Technologies Used
Language: SFML/C++ (Update based on what you used)

GUI: (Tkinter / Qt / Console-based — update this)

File System: Simulated in-memory or file-based system
